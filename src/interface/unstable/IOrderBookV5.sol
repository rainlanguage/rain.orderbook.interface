/// @title IOrderBookV5
/// @notice An orderbook that deploys _strategies_ represented as interpreter
/// expressions rather than individual orders. The order book contract itself
/// behaves similarly to an `ERC4626` vault but with much more fine grained
/// control over how tokens are allocated and moved internally by their owners,
/// and without any concept of "shares". Token owners MAY deposit and withdraw
/// their tokens under arbitrary vault IDs on a per-token basis, then define
/// orders that specify how tokens move between vaults according to an expression.
/// The expression returns a maximum amount and a token input/output ratio from
/// the perpective of the order. When two expressions intersect, as in their
/// ratios are the inverse of each other, then tokens can move between vaults.
///
/// For example, consider order A with input TKNA and output TKNB with a constant
/// ratio of 100:1. This order in isolation has no ability to move tokens. If
/// an order B appears with input TKNB and output TKNA and a ratio of 1:100 then
/// this is a perfect match with order A. In this case 100 TKNA will move from
/// order B to order A and 1 TKNB will move from order A to order B.
///
/// IO ratios are always specified as input:output and are rain floating point
/// values. The maximum amount that can be moved in the current clearance is also
/// set by the order expression as a rain floating point value.
///
/// Typically orders will not clear when their match is exactly 1:1 as the
/// clearer needs to pay gas to process the match. Each order will get exactly
/// the ratio it calculates when it does clear so if there is _overlap_ in the
/// ratios then the clearer keeps the difference. In our above example, consider
/// order B asking a ratio of 1:110 instead of 1:100. In this case 100 TKNA will
/// move from order B to order A and 10 TKNA will move to the clearer's vault and
/// 1 TKNB will move from order A to order B. In the case of fixed prices this is
/// not very interesting as order B could more simply take order A directly for
/// cheaper rather than involving a third party. Indeed, Orderbook supports a
/// direct "take orders" method that works similar to a "market buy". In the case
/// of dynamic expression based ratios, it allows both order A and order B to
/// clear non-interactively according to their strategy, trading off active
/// management, dealing with front-running, MEV, etc. for zero-gas and
/// exact-ratio clearance.
///
/// The general invariant for clearing and take orders is:
///
/// ```
/// ratioA = InputA / OutputA
/// ratioB = InputB / OutputB
/// ratioA * ratioB = ( InputA * InputB ) / ( OutputA * OutputB )
/// OutputA >= InputB
/// OutputB >= InputA
///
/// ∴ ratioA * ratioB <= 1
/// ```
///
/// Orderbook is `IERC3156FlashLender` compliant with a 0 fee flash loan
/// implementation to allow external liquidity from other onchain DEXes to match
/// against orderbook expressions. All deposited tokens across all vaults are
/// available for flashloan, the flashloan MAY BE REPAID BY CALLING TAKE ORDER
/// such that Orderbook's liability to its vaults is decreased by an incoming
/// trade from the flashloan borrower. See `ZeroExOrderBookFlashBorrower` for
/// an example of how this works in practise.
///
/// Token amounts and ratios returned by calculate order MUST be rain floating
/// point values. Handle IO will receive these values as floating point values.
/// As token amounts are floats internally, they can represent any decimals that
/// the token might have. The _precision_ of the floating point values is capped
/// at 37 decimals generally because when packed the floats are normalized to
/// int128 values for the coefficients. Generally this means that the precision
/// is larger than the entire minted supply of almost all tokens in existence.
/// In the rare case of a token that has token balances in the orderbook larger
/// than 10^38, some truncation will occur after the 37th decimal place
/// internally, on the _least_ significant digits, so should not be an issue
/// even in extreme edge cases.
///
/// Internal float values are converted to absolute token values according to the
/// token's own `decimals` call only when tokens are moved by the orderbook. This
/// means that some tokens MAY NOT be supported:
/// - If the token does not implement `decimals` then the orderbook will revert
///   when trying to move tokens.
/// - If the token has a `decimals` value that is not a constant value then the
///   internal accounting will be incorrect and the orderbook will either be
///   drained of or lock up that token. (other tokens will not be impacted).
///
/// When two orders clear there are NO TOKEN MOVEMENTS, only internal vault
/// balances are updated from the input and output vaults. Typically this results
/// in less gas per clear than calling external token transfers and also avoids
/// issues with reentrancy, allowances, external balances etc. This also means
/// that REBASING TOKENS AND TOKENS WITH DYNAMIC BALANCE ARE NOT SUPPORTED.
/// Orderbook ONLY WORKS IF TOKEN BALANCES ARE 1:1 WITH ADDITION/SUBTRACTION PER
/// VAULT MOVEMENT.
///
/// Dust due to rounding errors always favours the order. Output max is rounded
/// down and IO ratios are rounded up. Input and output amounts are always
/// converted to absolute values before applying to vault balances such that
/// orderbook always retains fully collateralised inventory of underlying token
/// balances to support withdrawals, with the caveat that dynamic token balanes
/// are not supported.
///
/// When an order clears it is NOT removed. Orders remain active until the owner
/// deactivates them. This is gas efficient as order owners MAY deposit more
/// tokens in a vault with an order against it many times and the order strategy
/// will continue to be clearable according to its expression. As vault IDs are
/// `bytes` values there are effectively infinite possible vaults for any token
/// so there is no limit to how many active orders any address can have at one
/// time. This also allows orders to be daisy chained arbitrarily where output
/// vaults for some order are the input vaults for some other order.
///
/// Expression storage is namespaced by order owner, so gets and sets are unique
/// to each onchain address. Order owners MUST TAKE CARE not to override their
/// storage sets globally across all their orders, which they can do most simply
/// by hashing the order hash into their get/set keys inside the expression. This
/// gives maximum flexibility for shared state across orders without allowing
/// order owners to attack and overwrite values stored by orders placed by their
/// counterparty.
///
/// Note that each order specifies its own interpreter and deployer so the
/// owner is responsible for not corrupting their own calculations with bad
/// interpreters. This also means the Orderbook MUST assume the interpreter, and
/// notably the interpreter's store, is malicious and guard against reentrancy
/// etc.
///
/// As Orderbook supports any expression that can run on any `IInterpreterV1` and
/// counterparties are available to the order, order strategies are free to
/// implement KYC/membership, tracking, distributions, stock, buybacks, etc. etc.

    ///   negative spread will need to be larger
    /// - Erratic behavior of the order owner could reduce the willingness of
    ///   third parties to interact if it could result in wasted gas due to
    ///   orders suddently being removed before clearance etc.
    /// - Dynamic and highly volatile words used in the expression could be
    ///   ignored or low priority by clearers who want to be sure that they can
    ///   accurately predict the ratios that they include in their clearance

    ///   cause issues for certain owners and clearers
